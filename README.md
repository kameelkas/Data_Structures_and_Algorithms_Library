# Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Library
A library for many commonly used data structures and algorithms. Completed with @eshiAkalumhe14

## Date Completed:
April 2023

## Description
This project makes use of most of the commonly used and practical data structures and algorithms.
Programmed in Java, the project has methods for common operations for lists (singly, doubly and circularly linked),
queues, stacks, and trees. 

## Running the Program
Run the 'AlgorithmsTest.java' file in any terminal/IDE of your choice. This is a test file that demonstrates all operations programmed for each data structure/algorithm.
